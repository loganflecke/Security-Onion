# Security Onion Senior Project Evaluation

## Improvements

### 1. Configure Cuckoo Malware Sandbox

One significant improvement for the Security Onion senior project would be to configure the Cuckoo malware sandbox on its own virtual machine. Unfortunately, due to immense troubleshooting challenges and time constraints, this aspect of the project was not completed as initially planned. Implementing Cuckoo in a separate virtual machine would enhance the overall effectiveness of the malware analysis capabilities.

## Limitations

### 1. Latency Issues

A primary limitation encountered during the project was latency, primarily stemming from the older CPU's clock speed. The outdated hardware posed challenges in terms of processing speed, affecting the overall performance of the Security Onion setup. To mitigate this limitation, it is imperative to explore strategies for compensating for the slow clock speed, whether through hardware upgrades or optimization techniques.

### 2. Networking Challenges with Hyper-V

Another limitation was the decision to use Hyper-V as the virtualization platform, which introduced unexpected networking problems. Dealing with these issues consumed a considerable amount of time, diverting attention from other critical project aspects. In future iterations, considering alternative virtualization solutions or addressing Hyper-V's networking challenges upfront could streamline the project timeline.

## Next Steps

To enhance the project and address these limitations, I would consider the following next steps:

- **Cuckoo Configuration:**
  - Allocate dedicated time to troubleshoot and configure Cuckoo on a separate virtual machine.
  - Leverage community resources and documentation to overcome challenges faced during the initial attempts.

- **Latency Mitigation:**
  - Investigate strategies to compensate for the slow clock speed of the CPU, such as optimizing configurations or upgrading hardware components.
  - Explore the feasibility of utilizing additional resources, such distributed computing, to improve overall system performance.

- **Virtualization Platform Consideration:**
  - Evaluate alternative virtualization platforms that may better suit the project requirements and minimize networking challenges.
  - Conduct thorough testing with the chosen platform to ensure compatibility and mitigate potential issues before full-scale implementation.

By addressing these improvements and limitations, Security Onion can achieve enhanced functionality and efficiency in threat detection and analysis.
